# Patch pandaPiGrounder to add 4 options:
# 1. only-write-state-features -> write only state features in the ground files so skip methods and operators
# 2. quick-compute-state-features -> if the problem is slow to compute, compute an overestimation of the state features more quickly but lose in optimality. Need flag only-write-state-features to be set.
# 3. exit-after-invariants -> exit after having computed lifted FAM groups. Needs option invariants
# 4. out-invariants -> write the lifted FAM groups to the file specified. Needs option invariants string default=""
